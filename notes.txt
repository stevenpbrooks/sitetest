-- USING REACT and NEXT.JS (server side) and MATERIAL-UI

--To setup npm and package.json and next (which does the server side serving) go to your root and:
npm init -y
npm install --save react react-dom next react-router-dom nprogress @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons

-- to debug use of hooks:
--npm i eslint-plugin-react-hooks

Then open the package.json file in the web root directory and replace scripts with the following:
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
}

-- next must have a pages directory

-- the nested-menu package was installed as a react-app, not a NEXT 
--npx create-react-app nested-menu

--To run the site:
npm run dev
